# A benchmark for time-frequency denoising/ detecting methods

## What is this benchmark?

A benchmark is a comparison between different methods when running an standardized test. The goal of this benchmark is to compare different methods for denoising / detecting a signal based on different characterizations of the time-frequency representation of the signal. In particular, our goal is to evaluate the performance of techniques based on the zeros of the spectrogram and to contrast them with more traditional methods, like those based on the ridges of that time-frequency distribution.

Nevertheless, the methods to compare, the tests, and the performance evaluation functions were conceived as different modules, so that one can assess new methods without modifying the tests or the signals. On the one hand, the tests and the performance evaluation functions are encapsulated in the class `Benchmark`. On the other hand, the signals used in this benchmark are generated by the methods in the class `SignalBank`. The only restriction this poses is that the methods should satisfy some requirements regarding the *shape of their input an output parameters*.

You can use this benchmark to test a new method against others. There are at least to ways of doing this. You can either make a new branch of this repository and push a new method to test, or you can clone this repository and benchmark your own method locally, i.e. in your computer.

The `notebook` folder contains a number of minimal working examples to understand how this benchmark works and how could you use it for your project. In particular, *demo_benchmark.ipynb* introduces de idea of the benchmark and give two minimal working examples of how to use it. Additionally, the notebook *demo_signal_bank.ipynb* shows the signals produced by the `SignalBank` class.

## How to use this benchmark?

There two ways of using this benchmark to test new methods:

1. Create a new branch of this repository
2. Running the benchmark locally

### 1. Benchmark new methods by branching this repository

### 2. Cloning and running this benchmark locally

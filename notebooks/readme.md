# Notebooks

## Run the notebooks locally

In order to run the notebooks locally, you will first need a local copy of the repository. You can clone the repository in a local folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmiramont/benchmarks-detection-denoising
```

After this, you can use  `poetry` to easily install the dependencies of the project in a virtual environment.

```bash
poetry install --with notebooks
```

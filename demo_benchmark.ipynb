    "## What is this benchmark?\n",
    "A benchmark is a comparison between different methods when running an standarized test. The goal of this benchmark is to compare different methods for denoising / detecting a signal based on the properties of the time-frequency plane. This particular benchmark has been created for evaluating the performance of techniques based on the zeros of the spectrogram and to contrast them with more traditional methods, like those based on the ridges in the time-frequency plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the purpose of making this benchmark more useful, the methods to compare, the tests, and the performance evaluation functions where concived as different modules, so that one can test newer methods in the future without modifing the tests. The only restrictions this pose is that the methods to test should satisfy some requirements regarding the shape of their input an output parameters. The tests, comprising the signals used and the performance evaluation functions, are encapsulated in the class `Benchmark`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compare different methods with possibly different parameters, we need to set up a few things before running the benchmark. A `Benchmark` object receives some input parameters to configure the test:\n",
    "- `task`: This could be `'denoising'` or `'detecting'`. The first one compute the quality reconstruction factor (QRF) using the output of the method, whereas the second simply consist in detecting wheter a signal is present or not.\n",
    "- `N`: The length of the simulation, i.e. how many samples should the signals have.\n",
    "- `methods`: A dictionary of methods. Each entry of this dictionary corresponds to the function that implements each of the desired methods.\n",
    "- `parameters`: A dictionary of parameters. Each entry of this dictionary corresponds to an array of tuples to pass as input parameters to each method. In order to know which parameters should be passed to each methods, the keys of this dictionary should be the same as those corresponding to the individual methods in the corresponding dictionary.\n",
    "- `SNRin`: A list or tuple of values of SNR to test.\n",
    "- `repetitions`: The number of times the experiment should be repeated with different realizations of noise."

    "First let's define a dummy method for testing. Methods should receive an `M`x`N` array of noisy signals, where `M` is the number of signals, and `N` is the number of time samples. Additionally, it should receive a second parameter `params` to test different combinations of parameters of the method. The shape of the output depends on the task (denoising or detecting). So the firm of a method should be the following:\n",
